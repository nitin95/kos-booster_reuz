# kos-booster_reuz
Set of autopilots to fully automate launch and recovery of orbital rocket boosters and SSTOs. Functions are derived from winged's landing script, and I'm porting it to make it universal and for  multiple booster landings.

As of 15th June, 2018, I've got a landing script that can do a nearly perfect full mission(including orbital insertion), with some calibration needed for boostback.

Cheers!
