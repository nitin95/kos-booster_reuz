# kos-booster_reuz
Set of autopilots to fully automate launch and recovery of orbital rocket boosters and SSTOs. Functions are originally derived from Caleb's landing script, but I'm trying to make it independent of Trajectories for simultaneous booster landings.

As of 30th April, 2018, I've got a grasshopper script that can do a nearly perfect full mission hoverslam, but throttle PIDs aren't working. It can hoverslam from low heights(<1km) though.

Once grasshopper is debugged, I'll move on to add boostback and navigation capabilities. Expect this work to take a couple weeks.

In the meantime, I'm extracting whatever code I can from existing landing scripts. Marcus House's Mun mission script is also included for potential interplanetary missions.
