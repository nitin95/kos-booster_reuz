Autopilot 2.0.3

Set of autopilots cobbled together to fully automate launch and recovery of orbital rocket boosters and SSTOs. Right now, only booster landings are supported.

Functions are derived from mrbradleyjh's landing script, and I'm porting it to make it universal and for multiple booster landings.

As of 2nd July, 2018, I've started integrating Nessus's script logic to improve accuracy upto the point where ASDS landings are possible.

Autopilot 2.1 will most likely be out this month; It'll be out, come what may.

Cheers!
