Autopilot 2.0.5

Set of autopilots cobbled together aiming to fully automate launch and recovery of orbital rocket boosters and SSTOs. Right now, only booster landings are supported.

Hoverslam functions are derived from mrbradleyjh's script, boostback algorithms are from Nessus's script, orbital autopilot is a trimmed down version of Seth Persigehl's launch autopilot and the rest is me.

As of 20th July, 2018, progress is solid on the project. I integrated the old boostback workflow from Caleb9000's code, but it's having trouble working with the distance functions. Will be debugged in the coming days.

Autopilot 2.1 will be out in July, come what may.

Cheers!
