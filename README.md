Autopilot 2.0.2

Set of autopilots to fully automate launch and recovery of orbital rocket boosters and SSTOs. Right now, only booster landings are supported.

Functions are derived from mrbradleyjh's landing script, and I'm porting it to make it universal and for multiple booster landings.

As of 22nd June, 2018, I've got a landing script that can do a perfect full mission(including orbital insertion) with same workflow and constraints as Autopilot 1.0 (Caleb9000 base), but works for simultaneous control. Most of the work left is in making boostback more robust, and stabilizing the orbit script. Also need to add auto switching and warp functionality.

With this, I think a full autopilot release (2.1) can be done in the next couple weeks. Will launch with the demo video, keep watching the YouTube channel.

Cheers!
