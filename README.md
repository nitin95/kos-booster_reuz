Autopilot 2.1

Set of autopilots cobbled together aiming to fully automate launch and recovery of orbital rocket boosters and SSTOs. Right now, only booster landings are supported.

Hoverslam functions are derived from mrbradleyjh's script, boostback algorithms are mine, orbital autopilot is a trimmed down version of Seth Persigehl's launch autopilot and I added a few features and optimized the code.

UPDATE 2.1:

-Renamed autopilots; land and landbfr for RTLS of boosters, core for orbital stage.
-Fully functional booster recovery without Trajectories requirement.
-hoverslam can be independently used to land on any body.
-Further optimizing launcher1.ks for low thrust second stages.

Cheers!
