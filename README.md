# kos-booster_reuz
Set of autopilots to fully automate launch and recovery of orbital rocket boosters and SSTOs. Functions are derived from winged's landing script, and I'm porting it to make it universal and for  multiple booster landings.

As of 7th May, 2018, I've got a landing script that can do a nearly perfect full mission(including orbital insertion), but I'm having trouble with the boostback algorithm. Will look into that next weekend.

Once I can work out the boostback script, I'll start adding more functionality.
Cheers!
